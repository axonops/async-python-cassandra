Feature: Production Reliability Requirements
  As a production system using async-cassandra
  I need the driver to handle failures gracefully
  So that my application remains stable under adverse conditions

  Background:
    Given a production-like Cassandra cluster with 3 nodes
    And async-cassandra configured with production settings
    And comprehensive monitoring is enabled

  @critical @resilience
  Scenario: Cassandra node failure during query
    Given an active async session with queries in progress
    When one Cassandra node fails
    Then queries to other nodes should continue normally
    And queries to the failed node should retry on healthy nodes
    And no queries should hang indefinitely
    And all connections should be properly cleaned up

  @critical @performance
  Scenario: Thread pool exhaustion prevention
    Given a configured thread pool of 10 threads
    When I submit 1000 concurrent queries
    Then all queries should eventually complete
    And no deadlock should occur
    And memory usage should remain stable
    And response times should degrade gracefully

  @critical @memory
  Scenario: Memory leak prevention under load
    Given a baseline memory measurement
    When I execute 100,000 queries over 1 hour
    Then memory usage should not grow continuously
    And garbage collection should work effectively
    And no resource warnings should be logged
    And performance should remain consistent

  @critical @resilience
  Scenario: Rolling restart of Cassandra cluster
    Given continuous query load of 100 queries/second
    When Cassandra nodes are restarted one by one
    Then query success rate should remain above 99%
    And no data inconsistencies should occur
    And connection pool should rebalance automatically
    And application should not require restart

  @network @resilience
  Scenario: Network partition handling
    Given queries distributed across all nodes
    When a network partition isolates one node
    Then queries should failover to reachable nodes
    And partition should be detected within 5 seconds
    And error messages should clearly indicate the issue
    When the partition heals
    Then the isolated node should rejoin automatically

  @critical @data-integrity
  Scenario: Ensure consistency during failures
    Given concurrent write operations
    When various failures occur:
      | failure_type        | description                  |
      | node_crash          | Coordinator node crashes     |
      | network_timeout     | Response delayed beyond timeout |
      | partial_write       | Write succeeds on some replicas |
    Then data consistency should be maintained
    And failed writes should be clearly reported
    And successful writes should be durable
    And read-after-write consistency should work

  @performance @scale
  Scenario: Handle traffic spikes gracefully
    Given normal load of 100 queries/second
    When traffic suddenly spikes to 1000 queries/second
    Then the system should scale up gracefully
    And response times should increase linearly, not exponentially
    And no queries should be dropped
    And the system should recover when spike ends

  @monitoring @alerting
  Scenario: Production monitoring and alerting
    Given production monitoring thresholds:
      | metric                    | threshold  |
      | query_timeout_rate        | < 1%       |
      | connection_pool_exhaustion| 0          |
      | p99_latency              | < 100ms    |
      | error_rate               | < 0.1%     |
    When I run under normal production load
    Then all metrics should stay within thresholds
    And alerts should fire if thresholds are breached
    And metric history should be retained for analysis

  @critical @chaos
  Scenario: Chaos engineering resilience
    Given a chaos testing framework
    When I introduce random failures:
      | chaos_type           | probability |
      | network_delay        | 5%          |
      | node_failure         | 1%          |
      | query_timeout        | 2%          |
      | connection_drop      | 1%          |
    Then the application should remain functional
    And error rates should stay below 5%
    And no data corruption should occur
    And system should self-heal without intervention

  @deployment @zero-downtime
  Scenario: Zero-downtime deployment
    Given a running application under load
    When I deploy a new version of the application
    Then the deployment should use rolling updates
    And no requests should fail during deployment
    And connection pools should transfer gracefully
    And monitoring should show no service disruption
