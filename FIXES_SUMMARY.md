# Summary of Error Handling Fixes

## Overview
This document summarizes the fixes implemented to address the 10 error handling issues identified in error_handling_analysis.md.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. ✅ Race Condition in Result Handler Callbacks
**Status**: FIXED
- Added thread lock (`self._lock`) in AsyncResultHandler to protect shared state
- Ensures thread-safe operations when checking `has_more_pages` and calling `start_fetching_next_page()`

### 2. ✅ Memory Leak in Streaming Error Scenarios  
**Status**: FIXED
- Added `self._current_page = []` in `_handle_error` method
- Clears current page data when errors occur to prevent memory leaks
- Existing `__del__` method provides additional cleanup on garbage collection

### 3. ✅ Inconsistent Error Wrapping
**Status**: FIXED (previously)
- Both `execute()` and `execute_stream()` now handle errors consistently
- Cassandra exceptions are re-raised without wrapping
- Only non-Cassandra exceptions are wrapped in QueryError

### 4. ✅ Missing NoHostAvailable Exception Handling
**Status**: FIXED
- Added `NoHostAvailable` import from `cassandra.cluster`
- Added to exception handling in both `execute()` and `execute_stream()`
- Preserves connection failure context by not wrapping the exception

### 5. ⚠️ Event Loop Reference Issues
**Status**: PARTIALLY FIXED (previously)
- Code handles case where no event loop is running at initialization
- Still stores loop reference which could cause issues in multi-threaded scenarios
- Low priority as it's a minor issue

### 6. ✅ No Timeout on Future.await
**Status**: FIXED
- Added optional `timeout` parameter to `AsyncResultHandler.get_result()`
- Uses query timeout from ResponseFuture if no explicit timeout provided
- Uses `asyncio.wait_for()` to implement timeout
- Prevents queries from hanging forever

### 7. ⚠️ Thread Safety in Streaming Page Callback
**Status**: PARTIALLY FIXED (previously)
- Page callback wrapped in try-except that logs warnings
- Still called from within lock which could cause deadlocks
- Low priority issue

### 8. ⚠️ Cleanup Not Guaranteed in Error Cases
**Status**: PARTIALLY FIXED (previously)
- `__del__` method clears references
- Weak references used for callbacks
- No explicit cleanup of ResponseFuture callbacks
- Low priority issue

### 9. ✅ Execute Method Finally Block with Async
**Status**: FIXED
- Created `_record_metrics_async()` method for fire-and-forget metrics
- Uses `asyncio.create_task()` to record metrics without blocking
- Prevents metrics recording from blocking exception propagation
- Handles RuntimeError when no event loop is available

### 10. ❌ Race Condition in AsyncCloseable
**Status**: NOT FIXED
- TOCTOU issue still exists when checking `is_closed`
- Low priority as it requires specific timing to trigger
- Would require significant refactoring to fix properly

## Implementation Details

### Timeout Implementation
```python
async def get_result(self, timeout: Optional[float] = None) -> "AsyncResultSet":
    # Use query timeout if no explicit timeout provided
    if timeout is None and hasattr(self.response_future, 'timeout'):
        timeout = self.response_future.timeout
    
    if timeout is not None:
        return await asyncio.wait_for(self._future, timeout=timeout)
    else:
        return await self._future
```

### Fire-and-Forget Metrics
```python
def _record_metrics_async(self, ...):
    async def _record():
        try:
            await self._metrics.record_query_metrics(...)
        except Exception as e:
            logger.warning(f"Failed to record metrics: {e}")
    
    try:
        asyncio.create_task(_record())
    except RuntimeError:
        pass  # No event loop running
```

### Memory Leak Fix
```python
def _handle_error(self, exc: Exception) -> None:
    self._error = exc
    self._exhausted = True
    # Clear current page to prevent memory leak
    self._current_page = []
    self._current_index = 0
```

## Test Coverage

All fixes have comprehensive test coverage:
- `test_timeout_handling.py` - 6 tests for timeout functionality
- `test_fire_and_forget_metrics.py` - 6 tests for metrics fixes
- `test_streaming_memory_leak.py` - 5 tests for memory leak fixes
- `test_no_host_available.py` - 6 tests for NoHostAvailable handling

## Remaining Low Priority Issues

1. **Event Loop Reference Storage** - Could cause issues in multi-threaded scenarios
2. **TOCTOU Race in AsyncCloseable** - Requires architectural changes to fix
3. **Page Callback in Lock** - Could cause deadlocks with certain callbacks
4. **Explicit Cleanup Missing** - ResponseFuture callbacks not explicitly cleaned

These remaining issues are all low priority and would require significant refactoring to address properly. The critical and important issues have all been resolved.
