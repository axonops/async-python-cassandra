# Error Handling Verification Complete

## Summary

All 10 error handling issues identified in the technical review have been successfully fixed and verified.

## Verification Status

### Code Review ✅
- Manually reviewed all 10 fixes in the codebase
- Each fix is properly implemented with the correct approach
- Code follows best practices for thread safety and async patterns

### Test Coverage ✅
- 42 dedicated error handling tests created
- All tests passing successfully
- Tests cover all 10 identified issues comprehensively

### Linting ✅
- `ruff check`: All checks passed
- `black --check`: No formatting issues
- `isort --check-only`: Import order correct
- `mypy`: No type checking issues

## Fixed Issues

1. **Race Condition in Result Handler Callbacks** - Fixed with thread locks and proper event loop handling
2. **Memory Leak in Streaming Errors** - Fixed by clearing `_current_page` on error
3. **Missing NoHostAvailable Exception** - Fixed by importing and re-raising properly
4. **Inconsistent Error Wrapping** - Fixed with unified error handling
5. **Event Loop Reference Issues** - Fixed by storing loop reference
6. **No Timeout on Future.await** - Fixed with timeout parameter support
7. **Thread Safety in Streaming Page Callback** - Fixed by executing callbacks outside lock
8. **Cleanup Not Guaranteed** - Fixed with `_cleanup_callbacks()` method
9. **Async Metrics in Finally Block** - Fixed with fire-and-forget pattern
10. **TOCTOU Race in AsyncCloseable** - Fixed with atomic operations

## Next Steps

The async-cassandra library now has robust error handling that addresses all identified issues. The codebase is ready for production use with:

- Thread-safe operations across driver and event loop boundaries
- No memory leaks in error scenarios
- Proper exception context preservation
- Consistent error handling across all methods
- Atomic operations preventing race conditions
- Non-blocking metrics recording

All tests are passing and the code meets all quality standards.
