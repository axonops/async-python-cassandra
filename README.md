> ‚ö†Ô∏è **DEVELOPMENT WARNING**: This library is currently under active development and is NOT ready for production use. APIs may change without notice. Please use for testing and evaluation only.

## ‚ú® Overview

An async Python wrapper for the Cassandra Python driver that provides true asynchronous operations, addressing the performance limitations of the official driver when used with async frameworks like FastAPI.

The official Cassandra Python driver uses a separate thread pool for I/O operations, which can become a bottleneck in high-concurrency async applications. This library wraps the driver's async functionality to provide proper async/await support that integrates seamlessly with Python's asyncio event loop.

## üöÄ Key Features

- ‚úÖ True async/await support for Cassandra operations
- ‚úÖ Optimized for the Python driver's connection model
- ‚úÖ Automatic retries with configurable policies
- ‚úÖ Support for prepared statements and batch operations
- ‚úÖ Type hints and full typing support
- ‚úÖ Compatible with FastAPI, aiohttp, and other async frameworks
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive test coverage including integration tests
- ‚úÖ Performance optimized for high-concurrency scenarios


## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.12 or higher
- Apache Cassandra 5.0+ (tested with 5.0, may work with earlier versions)
- cassandra-driver 3.29.2+

## üîß Installation

```bash
# From PyPI (when published)
pip install async-cassandra

# From source
pip install -e .
```

## üìö Quick Start

```python
import asyncio
from async_cassandra import AsyncCluster

async def main():
    # Connect to Cassandra
    cluster = AsyncCluster(['localhost'])
    session = await cluster.connect()
    
    # Execute queries
    result = await session.execute("SELECT * FROM system.local")
    print(f"Connected to: {result.one().cluster_name}")
    
    # Clean up
    await session.close()
    await cluster.shutdown()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

For more detailed examples, see our [Getting Started Guide](docs/getting-started.md).

## üèóÔ∏è Why async-cassandra?

The Cassandra Python driver uses a thread pool for I/O operations, which can become a bottleneck in async applications. This library provides true async/await support, enabling:

- **Better Performance**: Handle thousands of concurrent queries efficiently
- **Lower Resource Usage**: No thread pool overhead
- **Seamless Integration**: Works naturally with FastAPI, aiohttp, and other async frameworks
- **Proper Backpressure**: Async operations allow better control over concurrency

See our [Architecture Overview](docs/architecture.md) for technical details.

### üîÑ True Async Paging

The standard Cassandra driver's manual paging (`fetch_next_page()`) is synchronous, which blocks your entire async application:

```python
# ‚ùå With standard driver - blocks the event loop
result = await session.execute("SELECT * FROM large_table")
while result.has_more_pages:
    result.fetch_next_page()  # This blocks! Your app freezes here

# ‚úÖ With async-cassandra streaming - truly async
result = await session.execute_stream("SELECT * FROM large_table")
async for row in result:
    await process_row(row)  # Non-blocking, other requests keep flowing
```

This is critical for web applications where blocking the event loop means all other requests stop being processed. For a detailed explanation of this issue, see our [streaming documentation](docs/streaming.md#the-async-problem-with-manual-paging).
