# Security and Performance Improvements

This document outlines the critical security and performance improvements made to the async-cassandra library based on a comprehensive code review.

## Security Fixes

### 1. SQL Injection Prevention in `set_keyspace()`
- **Issue**: The `set_keyspace()` method was vulnerable to CQL injection attacks by directly interpolating user input into queries
- **Fix**: Added input validation to ensure keyspace names only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores
- **Impact**: Prevents potential arbitrary CQL command execution

### 2. Thread-Safe Shutdown Operations
- **Issue**: Race conditions could occur during cluster and session shutdown when multiple coroutines attempt concurrent shutdown
- **Fix**: Added `asyncio.Lock()` synchronization to both `AsyncCluster.shutdown()` and `AsyncCassandraSession.close()` methods
- **Impact**: Ensures proper resource cleanup and prevents potential crashes or resource leaks

## Performance Improvements

### 1. Removed Unnecessary Async Overhead
- **Issue**: `AsyncResultSet.__anext__()` included `await asyncio.sleep(0)` on every row iteration
- **Fix**: Removed the unnecessary sleep call
- **Impact**: Significant performance improvement for result iteration, especially for large result sets

### 2. Better Exception Handling
- **Issue**: Generic exception catching could hide important Cassandra-specific errors
- **Fix**: Added specific handling for Cassandra exceptions (InvalidRequest, Unavailable, ReadTimeout, WriteTimeout, OperationTimedOut)
- **Impact**: Better error diagnosis and proper retry policy behavior

## Code Quality Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Test Coverage
- Added test for keyspace name validation
- Maintained 97.59% code coverage after security improvements

### 2. Import Corrections
- Fixed incorrect import of `UnavailableException` (should be `Unavailable`)
- Ensures compatibility with the cassandra-driver API

## Recommendations for Future Improvements

### High Priority
1. **Connection Pooling**: Implement connection pooling at the cluster level for better resource utilization
2. **Streaming Support**: Add support for streaming large result sets to prevent memory issues
3. **Comprehensive Integration Tests**: Add tests for concurrent operations and network failure scenarios

### Medium Priority
1. **Type Hints**: Replace generic `Any` types with specific cassandra-driver types
2. **Metrics/Observability**: Add hooks for monitoring and performance tracking
3. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Implement circuit breakers for failing nodes

### Low Priority
1. **Async Generators**: Consider using async generators for result streaming
2. **Backpressure Handling**: Implement backpressure for slow consumers
3. **Documentation**: Add more code examples and best practices

## Testing

All changes have been tested and verified:
- Unit tests: 57 tests passing
- Code coverage: 97.59%
- Build: Successfully builds wheel and source distribution
- No breaking changes to the public API
